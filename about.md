# Hi! I'm Sam.

I'm a staff software engineer. I'm starting at Stripe! Spent the last 5 years at Google, working on building "mindblowing search experiences" (Hi, Mark!). Before that, I worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on climate science (but had a nuclear-secrets clearance for no good reason that I never got to use).
