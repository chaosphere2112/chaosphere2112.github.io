## Hi! I'm Sam.

I'm (apparently) a software engineer. I've been working in the industry since around 2012. I worked for a number of years at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov), first in the IT department (I was one of the developers who actually built www.llnl.gov, including a bunch of fun times transforming ancient HTML from the early 90s into structured data to ingest into Drupal) and then later working in the Climate Science organization, building [data visualization](https://www.github.com/cdat/vcs) and [analysis tools](https://www.github.com/cdat/cdms) for scientists. After the 2016 election, it seemed like government funded climate research probably wasn't going to be a huge growth industry, so I wound up moving to Google Search in early 2017. At Search, I grew from an IC to a Tech Lead Manager of a team of 10, building features and infrastructure for billions of hits per day.

I care a lot about numbers. At LLNL I spent a ton of time working on building better ways to analyse and visualize data; at Google, I spent a ton of time doing the analyzing and visualizing. I probably have written more SQL than most other programming languages. I'm fascinated by data-driven decision making and product development; identifying key places where there's room for improvement, drilling into the exact ways things go wrong, and building out targeted solutions. I also spend a lot of time contemplating organizational incentives, the impact of organizations on software and products, and juggling people problems with technical ones. 

I'm starting a new gig at Stripe at the end of February 2022- looking forward to dipping my toes into a new space!
