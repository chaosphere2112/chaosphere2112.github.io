# Hi! I'm Sam.

I'm a software engineer. I work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, on [a climate visualization open source project][uv-cdat], as well as a pile of other things.

I'm also a homebrewer. I like making hoppy beers, malty beers, dark beers, light beers... I really just enjoy making beer. So, yeah.
