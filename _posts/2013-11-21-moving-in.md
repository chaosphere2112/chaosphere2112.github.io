Pardon the mess, folks; setting up shop. Things will settle down in a week or so.

Wow, you actually clicked that link? Huh.

Well, since you're here...

###Hi, I'm Sam.

I'm a software developer, employed by Akima Infrastructure Services, contracted to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

I'm a pythonista, I'm a (mediocre) musician, and I'm an all-around geek. We'll see what winds up on here; hoping to have a home for things that I fiddle around with, a place to vomit out the contents of my brain, and a place to just share some stuff about what happens in my day to day life.

Thanks for reading; come back soon.
