title: Company Man, Part 1

As of Monday, November 18th, 2013, I'm an <span class='autotooltip' data-tooltip="Employee of a contracting firm that sublets me out to LLNL">employee</span> of <a href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>. It was a long road to get to that point, and there were some detours along the way. This is that story.

###In the Beginning

I went to school at [CSU, Chico][chico]. I applied to be a Chemistry Major, but by the time I got to school, I knew I wanted to do something else. I like to say that I started scrolling through the catalogue and stopped at the first thing that sounded interesting, but really I spent a fair amount of time doing some soul-searching, and then decided on Applied Computer Graphics; I was interested in building video games, and it seemed like a solid preparation for it.

Boy, was that **dumb**.

I'd *like* to say that I was smart enough to switch majors into Computer Science after the **first** of my programming professors told me I would do well in that major. I'd *like* to say I was smart enough to do it when the **second** told me the same thing.

I was pretty sure I knew what I was doing, and I was determined to become a video game developer, for some bizzare reason. I finally realized I would have been better off in computer science midway through my junior year, but at that point, I was tantalizingly close to graduation. Thankfully, two of my computer science friends ([Matthew Harris][mattben] and [Ben Carlsson][ben]) were interning at [LLNL][], and they both sent job recommendations to me, and I sent in an application for one of them. Their boss replied to me almost instantly, and I did a quick phone interview during which I established that I knew what inheritance was and I had used Objective C and Cocoa. Just like that, I had a six-month internship.

Well, almost.

First I had to come up with a ton of information for a background check. I had to come up with 5 references, 5 years of housing history, and 5 years of employment history. 

My start date was in June; unfortunately, I had a slight issue. I was almost completely broke, and I had to find housing in the bay area, which is, at the best of times, a nontrivial feat (I'm fond of [this article by priceonomics][priceonomics]). I tried to hunt down a place to live, but the only place I found on my first sweep through was over-priced, and I wound up bailing on renting there (despite my parents very kindly loaning me some money to make the security deposit). I ended up moving out of Chico the weekend of Father's Day, 2011, and started work on June 20th, and I was living out of my future in-laws' house.
