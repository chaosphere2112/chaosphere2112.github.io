_**Damn**, it's cold._
 
 The sun was barely up. I was sitting in the parking lot of the Starbucks off Vasco Road, in Livermore. I got out of the car and went in for some warmth; unfortunately, it was not forthcoming. The Starbucks was apparently unheated. The overly enthusiastic barista gave me the peppermint mocha that I was after, and I sat, savoring the warm drink for a few minutes. I flicked around my new iPhone, looked at the time, got up, and went back to my car.

_Let's do this thing._

I drove over to the Westgate Badging Office. It wouldn't open for another few minutes, so I sat in my car a little longer, polishing off the mocha. As it approached 7 AM, I finally left the warm embrace of my car and wandered over to the door. There was a man sitting next to it, holding the same orange packet I was.

"Pretty cold out."

"Yeah."

The door popped open, and we stepped inside. I walked up to the desk, handed over my ID, and received my fourth badge since I returned to Lawrence Livermore in June.

##Orientation Day

I was sitting on a bench with two other men, orange packets clenched in our hands. The man I had talked to outside reached a hand over and said his name was John.

"Sam. Who are you starting with?"

"Materials Management."

"Ah. I'm in ICS."

He wanted to know if I would be working in the building we had all been to before. I told him no, I was in another building, in the same corner of the lab.  Also, that I had been working there for more than a year (all told).

An older man walked into the room.

"I see you all have your packets; I'm Terry. There's supposed to be a fourth of you, but I guess he's running late. You should all head over to the Akima building."

We nodded, headed out to our cars. I turned into the lab; the other two headed out onto the main road. I realized that they didn't know anything about the roads in the lab yet. I drove over to the Akima building, and found a parking spot near where I had just a week before, when I signed my offer letter. I walked up to the building's side entrances, and went up the stairs.

"Locked? Really?"

Back down the stairs, up to the other door.

"Also locked. Great. Damn, it's cold."

I had no idea where the front entrance to the building was; fortunately, it's not a very big building. I found it, and the parking lot that I was probably supposed to have used. Oh well. I walked in, past the stench of cleaning chemicals and stale sweat that every gym has. Guess I finally figured out where the Lab's gym was. I walked up the stairs, and discovered that my memory of how the hallway was laid out was missing a few parts. Like the entire extra hallway that I was standing in. I looked back and forth a few times, took a few halting steps in one direction, then decided to go the other way. I found the hall I was looking for, and the memory flooded back (a bit belatedly). I found the conference room, where the other two men were waiting with their folders, water bottles and lanyards laid out for each of us. The fourth seat remained empty. I introduced myself to the other guy who I hadn't met (Vincent), and discovered that he was joining the janitorial staff. We chatted about the lab for a little bit; I suggested that he avoid the [Superblock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory#Plutonium_research).

Finally, Terry showed up again.

"The fourth guy is running late, so I'm here to keep you company till he gets in."

He asked how traffic was. He told us about his commute from Livermore to San Jos√© for years, and how he now does the reverse commute. Vincent mentioned that his drive in was nice (Hayward). John's was terrible (Stockton). Mine was the same as it ever was (Brentwood).

The fourth guy showed up.

"Sorry I'm late, I got stuck in traffic coming from Bay Point."

"Oh, 680 south? Nasty road." I chimed in.

"Yeah, it was that or take 4 east to Vasco."

"Which wouldn't have been any better, let me assure you."

His name was Thomas. He sat down next to me, and our orientation began.
