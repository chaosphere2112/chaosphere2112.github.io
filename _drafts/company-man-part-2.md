###Starting out in Livermore

<!-- more -->

I had to sit through a day's orientation; I watched a video featuring an ex-KGB spy who lectured us on how likely it was that we would be approached by foreigners trying to subvert us or something. I learned all about [ALARA][alara], which is just about the silliest term I've had a government entity apply to my health and well-being. I also had to run out at lunch in order to first obtain and then hand over a cashier's check consisting of the majority of my dwindling bank account to my future apartment manager.

Over the next six months, my financial situation improved. I learned a ton about software engineering, and about life in a corporation. It was... weird. I learned a little about enterprise development, a very small amount about enterprise java, and a whole lot about sitting in meetings. I also learned about how awesome it is having a steady income. My financial woes were solved, which was kind of crazy, coming into my senior year. I also managed to put thousands of miles on my 1991 camry; my fianc√©e was attending San Diego State University, and I trucked up and down the state as frequently as I could to come see her.
